      <h2>About the Game Idea</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This game was offered as a starting project for the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, by Ironhack. The
          idea
          consisted of practicing our fresh Frontend and Canvas skills with a free theme. I've pushed the boundaries a
          little
          bit further, once I was feeling comfortable with JavaScript and Canvas.
        </li>
        <li>Thus the idea could be improved to a level where we could experience fome kind of innovation, diverting
          someway of the status quo:</li>
        <li>We've always wished to <span>feel music</span>, travel along it within our memories and feelings. This game
          is a tribute to
          this desire, a sinestesic feel to music and sound. We try to imagine sound, we figured out how its fisics
          works
          but we've never climbed it, jumped over it, exhilirate ourselves by touching it.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Conceptual Design</span>, at this phase the main idea of the game was iterated among several
          possibilities, but tagging the possibilites of p5.sound.
          These concepts involved platform, rpg, GuitarHero clones with storytelling (a Star Wars storytelling) and
          sound making with envelopes. At the end, observing the
          time and scope restrictions, it was decided to make this platform game. Given that this generates level
          topology based on the music amplitude distribution over time, thus
          building unique levels.</li>
        <li><span>Preliminar Degisn</span> was conducted with testing in mind. The development here was driven, with
          some extention of planning, by trial and error.
          This approach revealed time consumming but very important for building algorithm coding skills for gaming and
          DOM manipulation. It also improved creativity to
          implement new game mechanics.</li>
        <li>And, finally, <span>Detailed Design and Prototype Deployment</span>. At this level the MVP was prepared to
          be deployed on GitHub pages. Code was organized and distributed among meaningull files and classes and, for
          the new platform, new debugging tooks place.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Bugs and Known Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Climbing</span> is, at the moment, missbehavioring. When you climb a wall and keep pressing up the
          player fly. (Whole new ideas for that).</li>
        <li><span>Player Flickering</span> is still an issue and will be dealt with within the next patch, this
          christmas.</li>
        <li><span>Level changing</span> is not yet implemented, keep an eye for the next chapters.</li>
        <li><span>Boosting Players</span> has been an issue: a mad mad mad horse to be tamed by these fingers who type
          here.</li>
        <li><span>Pause</span> button is working before game starts! Have to fix this...</li>
        <li><span>Have an issue?</span> Report here... oh wait, node.js yet to be coded.</li>
